# xchem-soakdb-2
A web-based replacement for SoakDB written in Django.

Currently the repo only contains a few mockups used to discuss the features and the user interface. At this stage the project is divided into three applications.

1) An interface for browsing compounds available in XChem in-house librraries, selecting the most suitable ones, and saving the selection for the experiment (experiment_preparation)

2) An equivalent of the current SoakDB for performing compound sreens. (compound_screen)

3) An equivalent of the current SoakDB for performing solvent characterisation. (solvent_characterisation)
